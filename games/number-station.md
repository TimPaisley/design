## Gameplay

All puzzles are separated into days, and each successive day serves to progress the plot. Each day, the player solves a series of puzzles using the various tools at their disposal and the clues on the desk (see below), after which they enter a secret code or message into their terminal and the day ends.

### Clues

At the start of each day, a new set of clues - in the form of sheets of paper, folders, photos, newspaper clippings, and so on - appear in the room.

### Tools

Scattered throughout the room are a number of objects that the player can use to solve various puzzles. The introduction of new tools will be interspersed throughout the days, with each new tool becoming progressively more complex to use or understand.

#### Radio

## Sound and Music

All in-game music is diegetic radio noise - either a secret station which the player can use to decipher a message, a music station that plays period-appropriate music (which may or may not also play a role in solving a puzzle), or (more often than not) radio noise/static.
